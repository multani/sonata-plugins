Extra plugins for `Sonata`_, a client for the `Music Player Daemon`_
====================================================================

This repository contains extra plugins for `Sonata`_, with various
functionalities which are not part of the main repository.

In order to get access to those plugins, you can drop the selected files into
``~/.config/sonata/plugins/`` and they should be then available to be activated
in Sonata itself (you may need to restart Sonata to see them).
